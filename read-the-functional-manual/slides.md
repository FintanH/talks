# This Guy

* Studied Computer Science in Trinity College, Dublin

* First exposure to Haskell in one of our modules

* Banged my head a bit more in the follow up module

* Began to see the light reading Haskell Programming From First Principles

* Three years of Python in LogoGrab, sneaking some Haskell in after a while

* Now working for Formation

* But the learning journey continues

* Documentation is the first point of contact

* What do we look for
